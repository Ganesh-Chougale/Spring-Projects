this python project remains same, we are creating 2nd backend with java-springBoot,
the main purpose of the backend is extract the existing database data & export the data in csv or sheet format

when i run the python project & hit the postman API  
Get: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/get_records`

it gives me output:
```json

...... & so on
}
```  



so what we want from spring-boot backend is from frontEnd we are getting the checkboxes from each field
author_id, authors, citation_id, cited_link, cited_value, link, p_year, publication, title
selected fields columns are draggables which means sequence can be anything. let me give you an example.
use selects 3 fields, authors, p_year & title. but he want a table in title, p_year & author as a column sequence. then he clicks on export columns then it will create sheet & csv file from it in chosen columns sequence. did you get the idea or i have to explain it to you more?


1. user clicks on check boxes which he wants to choose
2. he arranges the sequence of columns with drag & drop UI from frontEnd
3. after he clicks on export file, we fetch the desired data using our spring boot backend from database & generate a sheet or CSV file
